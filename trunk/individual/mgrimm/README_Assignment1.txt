I. Functionality
-------------------------------

This application implements the movement of the robot to a given goal. It is able to 
control the both the linear and angular velocity via PID controllers. 
Furthermore, the application indicates the status of the robot by changing light and 
sound features.  

II. Usage
-------------------------------

First connect the robot Thymio 2 via USB and start ROS with the command 

	$ roslaunch thymio_navigation_driver aseba_thymio.launch 

Open Eiffel and execute the application. You are going to be asked in the command window
to enter the x- and y- coordinate of your goal. Enter the coordinates and execute with ENTER.
Thymio 2 starts to move to your goal coordinates.

In the /<your-nethz-name>/roboscoop/thymio_app directory:
* app.e 		- main file of the project 

In the /<your-nethz-name>/roboscoop/thymio_app/rpl directory:
* robot.e 		- Robot abstraction class
* planner.e 		- Planning and execution of the behaviours
* controller.e 		- Class with two PID controller for the linear and angular velocity	
* error.e 		- Class for calculation of distance and orientation error
* feature_controller.e 	- Class	for regulation of features as light and sound

IV. How it works?
-------------------------------

APPLICATION class creates an instance of ROBOT class where the implemented behaviours of
the robot are called. Those behaviours are defined in the class PLANNER. Further, it accesses 
class CONTROLLER where the PID controller for the linear and angular velocity are
implemented. For the calculation of the distance and orientation error the additional 
class ERROR is passing on the data. The light and sound features within the CONTROLLER are
called from the class FEATURE_CONTROLLER.


V. Limitations
-------------------------------

Due to the inaccuracies of the robot THYMIO 2 it is adviced to properly calibrate the robot.
Otherwise the odometry data is misleading and your goal coordinates will not be reached
precisely.
